# Databricks-end-end-project
 End-to-End Data Engineering on Databricks: Customer & Sales Analytics

🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering solution using the Databricks platform. It follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to process customer, product, order, and regional sales data. The goal is to deliver curated, analytics-ready datasets that power business insights and dashboards.

# 🧱 Architecture

We implemented a multi-layered architecture to progressively refine data:

Raw Data → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → BI Dashboards

# 🧰 Technologies Used

* Databricks (Notebooks, Workflows, Unity Catalog)

* Apache Spark / PySpark

* Delta Lake for reliable, versioned data storage

* Spark SQL for data transformations

* Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)

# 📊 Data Pipeline Layers

🔸 Bronze Layer

Ingests raw CSV/JSON data into Delta format

Adds ingestion metadata (timestamp, filename)

## 🔹 Silver Layer

Cleans and transforms data using PySpark

Removes duplicates, handles nulls, normalizes data

Joins dimensions like customers, products, and regions


## 🥇 Gold Layer

Aggregates and enriches datasets for analytics

Customer KPIs, product sales performance, regional trends

Implements Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) logic

Implements SCD2 using Delta Live Tables (DLT) to track historical changes

# 🧑‍💻 Key Contributions

## 🔐 Access Management:
Granted access to Azure Data Lake, managed workspace and Unity Catalog permissions

## 🔧 Pipeline Development:
Designed and built scalable pipelines with PySpark and Delta Lake

## 📚 Unity Catalog:
Used for centralized governance, role-based access, and lineage tracking

## 🔁 Workflow Orchestration:
Scheduled jobs and managed dependencies with Databricks Workflows

## ✅ Data Quality Checks:
Implemented validation rules and exception handling

## 📈 Performance Optimization: 
Tuned Spark jobs for better resource utilization

📖 Documentation: Maintained notebooks and pipeline documentation for team handover and knowledge sharing

## 🔐 Security Management: 
Managed IAM roles, encryption, and permissions for secure Databricks environments

📈 Business Use Cases Enabled

Product sales tracking by category and region

Customer segmentation and engagement trends

Regional sales heatmaps and seasonality

Order-to-revenue funnel analysis

## 🧪 Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

PySpark and Spark SQL development

Delta Lake architecture and ACID compliance

SCD1 and SCD2 data modeling

Unity Catalog for governance

Workflow orchestration with Databricks Workflows

IAM and role-based access control

##  ✅ Project Outcome

A production-ready data pipeline that delivers clean, secure, and analytics-ready data to downstream BI tools (Power BI/Tableau). Scalable, maintainable, and extensible for future ML or real-time use cases.

## 📌 How to Use

This project is structured with modular notebooks per layer (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and per entity (Customers, Orders, Products, Regions). Includes parameterized configs and reusable functions.
